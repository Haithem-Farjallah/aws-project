what is the purpose of ech library ?  "express", "mysql", "body-parser", "cors" ?
-----------------
In short explanation:

express: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
mysql: A Node.js driver for MySQL.
body-parser: Middleware to parse incoming request bodies.
cors: Middleware to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.

-----------------
The libraries used in the Node.js backend serve different purposes. Let's go through each one:

1. Express:

	1.1 Purpose: Express is a web application framework for Node.js. 
	It simplifies the process of building robust web applications by 
	providing a set of features for routing, handling HTTP requests 
	and responses, and middleware support. Express makes it easier 
	to organize and structure your web application.


2. MySQL (mysql module):

	2.1 Purpose: The mysql module is used to interact with MySQL databases. 
	It allows Node.js applications to connect to MySQL databases, execute 
	SQL queries, and manage the flow of data between the application and the 
	database.


3. Body-parser:

	3.1 Purpose: The body-parser middleware is used to parse the body of 
	incoming HTTP requests. When a client sends data to the server, it is 
	often sent in the body of the request. body-parser parses this data 
	and makes it accessible in the req.body object. In the context of your 
	project, it is used to parse JSON data from the Angular frontend.


4. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):

	4.1 Purpose: CORS is a security feature implemented by web browsers 
	that restricts web pages from making requests to a different domain 
	than the one that served the web page. In a development environment 
	where your Angular app and Node.js server might be running on different 
	ports or domains, CORS can cause issues. The cors middleware is used 
	to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, allowing your Angular app 
	to make requests to the Node.js server.


In summary, these libraries collectively help in building a robust and 
secure web application. Express simplifies the web application development 
process, the mysql module facilitates communication with MySQL databases, 
body-parser handles parsing of request bodies, and cors enables cross-origin 
resource sharing.
